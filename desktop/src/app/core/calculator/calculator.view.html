      You can use the mining calculator to estimate how many MRT you can earn on average. You only need to know how fast your computer is able to
      mine. To find out, let it mine for at least 15 minutes, then you can see average number of cycles per second your PC is able to find.
      In the Desktop Lightwallet you can find cycles per second under the  Mining tab in the section called "Mining Rates" and noted as "Cycles Found/s".
    </p>
    <p>
      In Merit Core you will need to use command "getmininginfo" in the console and find the "cyclesps" value. Average computer CPUs have numbers
      around 0.01 - 0.1. Gaming graphic cards can get around 0.2 - 0.5 each. If you have trouble finding your speed, don't
      hesitate to ask the community in Discord, Telegram, or forum.

          If current net cycles/s are the same for the next 24 hours, and you mine without interruption at
          <strong>{{formData.controls.cyclesps.value}} cycles/s</strong>, your rewards will be approximately:
          <strong>{{dailyReward}} MRT</strong>

        <strong>Why did I get lower rewards than calculated?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Keep in mind that this is an estimate and that it is entirely possible to mine fewer MRT than predicted by the mining calculator. Calculations are based
        on comparing your cycles/s with average of global cycles/s in last 30 blocks. There are many reasons why you might
        not get as many MRT per day as estimated:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>You're not mining continuously</strong>
      </p>
      <p>This is probably the main cause with fewer rewards than predicted. The mining pools are not 100% stable and have occasional blackouts during
        the day. As a result, you are not actually mining continuously for 24 hours. It is also possible that your miner dropped the pool connection and fail
        to reconnect. You then need to restart it manually - until it's restarted you're also losing time mining.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>You're not mining continuously with the same cycles/s</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Check your cycles/s a couple times before you get enter a number into the mining calculator. It's possible that one or more cards stopped mining and the number
        of cycles calculated decreased. Merit mining software is in development and is not fully optimized yet.
        So you may need to pay attention to your mining rigs in order to achieve optimal results.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Net cycles/s changed</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        During mining, global cycles/s can change by couple of %. It shouldn't be very significant, but it's possible that these fluctuations will cause lower or higher
        results by up to 30%. Normally, you shouldn't see fluctuations outside of 10% in
        24 hours. You can always see current cycles/s on Network subpage.
