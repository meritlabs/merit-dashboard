      You can easily calculate how many Merits you can earn on average. You only need to know how fast is your computer able to
      mine. Let it mine at least 15 mins, then you can see average number how many cycles per second is your PC able to find.
      In Desktop wallet you can find it under Mining tab in "Mining Rates" section as "Cycles Found/s".

      In Merit Core you need to use command "getmininginfo" in console and "cyclesps" value. Average computer CPUs have numbers
      around 0.01 - 0.1. Gaming graphic cards can get around 0.2 - 0.5 each. If you have troubles finding your speed, don't
      hesitate to ask the community in Discord group, Telegram or forum.
