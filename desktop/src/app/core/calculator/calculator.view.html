      You can easily calculate how many Merits you can earn on average. You only need to know how fast is your computer able to
      mine. Let it mine at least 15 mins, then you can see average number how many cycles per second is your PC able to find.
      In Desktop wallet you can find it under Mining tab in "Mining Rates" section as "Cycles Found/s".
    </p>
    <p>
      In Merit Core you need to use command "getmininginfo" in console and "cyclesps" value. Average computer CPUs have numbers
      around 0.01 - 0.1. Gaming graphic cards can get around 0.2 - 0.5 each. If you have troubles finding your speed, don't
      hesitate to ask the community in Discord group, Telegram or forum.

          If current net cycles/s will be same for the next 24 hours, you will be mining without interruption at
          <strong>{{formData.controls.cyclesps.value}} cycles/s</strong>, your rewards will be approximately:
          <strong>{{dailyReward}} MRT</strong>

        <strong>Why I got lower rewards than calculated?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>I saw many complaints from miners that didn't receive as many Merits as calculator computed. Calculations are based
        on comparing your cycles/s with average of global cycles/s in last 30 blocks. There are some reasons why you might
        not get as many MRT per day as it's calculated:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>You're not mining 24 hours continuously</strong>
      </p>
      <p>This is probably main problem with lower rewards. For now, pools are not fully stable and have some blackouts during
        the day. It causes that you are not actually mining whole 24 hours. Also your miner can loose connection and fail
        to reconnect. You then need to restart it manually - until then you're again loosing time of mining.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>You're not mining 24 hours with same cycles/s</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Check your cycles/s couple times before you get some average. Also maybe one or more cards stopped mining and number
        of cycles calculated in second decreased. Merit mining software is in development and is not fully optimized yet.
        Pay more attention to your mining rigs when mining Merit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Net cycles/s changed</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        During your mining, global cycles/s can change by couple of %. It shouldn't be very significant but can cause lower or higher
        results up to 30% if it's increasing or decreasing quickly. Usually it shouldn't be changed for more than 10% in
        24 hours. You can always see current cycles/s on Network subpage.
